# French Press
## Brew your Add-ons with style

French Press is an experimental Firefox add-on library that allows developers
to write Firefox JS add-ons ("jetpacks") in CoffeeScript. It tries to make the
process as seamless as possible; the goal is to have to edit ZERO JavaScript
while writing your add-on, instead writing everything -- even your "main.js"
file -- in CoffeeScript.

It's pretty hacky right now and I've only thus far used it in a very small
add-on, but it does work. Patches are *very* welcome.
